I am currently a Senior Engineer at Baidu Inc. Prior to this, I earned my Ph.D. from Beihang University (BUAA) in June 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Shizhenwei, head of the [LEVIR Lab](https://levir.buaa.edu.cn/). During my doctoral studies, I also interned at Baidu, where I had the opportunity to work closely with Dr. Guoxi Huang (黄国熙) and Prof. [Zeke Xie (谢泽柯)](https://sites.google.com/view/zeke-xie).

My research interests lie primarily in video and image generation, as well as video and image editing. <span style="color:red"> I am currently looking for highly motivated interns to join ongoing research projects. If you're passionate about these topics, feel free to reach out!</span>
