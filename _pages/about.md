I am currently a Senior Engineer at Baidu Inc. Prior to this, I received my Ph.D. from Beihang University (BUAA) in June 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Shizhenwei. During my doctoral studies, I also interned at Baidu, where I had the opportunity to work closely with Dr. Guoxi Huang and Prof. Zeke Xie.

My research interests lie primarily in video and image generation, as well as video and image editing. I am actively seeking motivated interns to collaborate on research projects in these areas.
